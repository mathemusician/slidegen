## 🎯 Recommended Priority Order

### Phase 1: Critical (Do Now)
1. **API Integration Tests** - Ensures backend reliability
2. **E2E Tests** - Catches user-facing bugs
3. **PowerPoint Validation** - Core feature must work

### Phase 2: Important (Do Soon)
4. **Unit Tests** - Better code coverage
5. **Accessibility Tests** - Legal & ethical
6. **Performance Tests** - User experience

### Phase 3: Nice to Have
7. **Cross-Browser Tests**
8. **AI Bias/Regression Tests**
9. **Monitoring Setup**

### Phase 4: Optional
10. **Visual Regression**
11. **i18n Tests**
